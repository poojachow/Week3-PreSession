Path Sum:
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.
Example :
Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

              5
             / \
            4   8
           /   / \
          11  13  4
         /  \      \
        7    2      1
return true, as there exist a root-to-leaf path 5->4->11->2 which sum is 22.
Return 0 / 1 ( 0 for false, 1 for true ) for this problem


Postorder Traversal:
Given a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodesâ€™ values.

Sorted Insert Position:
Given a sorted array and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.
You may assume no duplicates in the array.

Square Root of Integer:
Implement int sqrt(int x).
Compute and return the square root of x.
If x is not a perfect square, return floor(sqrt(x))
Example :
Input : 11
Output : 3
DO NOT USE SQRT FUNCTION FROM STANDARD LIBRARY
